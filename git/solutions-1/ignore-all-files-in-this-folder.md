# Ignore all files in this folder

### Ignore all files in this folder

When you want to ignore files but want to keep a directory you can add a **`.gitignore`** file within the desired directory with the following content

```bash
*
!.gitignore
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
