* Go to your application root folder
* Give permissions to your `storage`folder

```bash
sudo chmod -R 775 storage
```

* The right thing is to have `775` permissions to this folder then change only the group to allow both your user and the webserver user to write into those folders

  ```text
  sudo chgrp www-data storage/framework/cache
  sudo chgrp www-data storage/framework/cache/data
  ```
